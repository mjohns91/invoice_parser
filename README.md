# Invoice Parser

Invoice Parser is a Python-based pdf mining tool specifically structured to extract pieces of data within pdf files and use those to accomplish various needs.
It utilizes tkinter GUI widgets to make the program easy to work with for users not familiar with a console.
This tool was made specifically to automate a laborious process in my capacity at work.

## Current Usage

The most current version of the parser specifically copies and renames every pdf based on invoice dates and invoice numbers, eliminating the need to do this manually. It currently does NOT implement deletion of files.
Currently, Invoice Parser does not utilize classes due to its small size, but future iterations may require more structure.
