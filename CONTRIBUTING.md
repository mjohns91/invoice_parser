# How to Contribute to Invoice Parser

Thank you for taking the time to look into the Invoice Parser project and how to contribute!

This project started out very small and has the potential to be much more than a simple pdf parser for a single workflow.

## Check out the README file to learn about the project

A brief overview of the project can be found in the [README](./README.md) file.

This README will contain details on the project's purpose and latest features/design.

## Making changes

### Get the code on your device and branch it

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a working branch for your own changes (name it whatever you want)

### Commit an update

Once you have completed your changes locally, commit the changes.

### Create a pull request

Provide as much detail as you can muster for your changes and additions. Once a request is reviewed, there may be some additional back and forth to clarify changes.

Once everything looks good, the PR will be merged and your contributions will be forever live on here, helping others with pdfs!
